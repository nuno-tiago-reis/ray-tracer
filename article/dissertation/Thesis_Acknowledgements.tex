I would like to thank my two supervisors, Professor Jo√£o Madeiras Pereira and Dr. Vasco Costa first for giving me the opportunity to work on a subject that I enjoy. Secondly for all the support over the course of these past few months, without their help I would not have gotten as far I as did.

Finally I would also like to thank you my family and my closest friends, for their support and encouragement during these hard months of work.
